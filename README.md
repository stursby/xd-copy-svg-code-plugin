## Install

### From the XD market

The easiest way is to get the plugin via the XD market. To do so, open XD and in the menu, navigate to `Plugins` > `Discover Plugins` and then search for "SVG" and it should be the fist one. Here's a demo of how it works!

### From GitHub releases

Head over to the [Latest Releases](https://github.com/stursby/xd-copy-svg-code-plugin/releases) page and then downloaded the newest `.xdx` file. Once downloaded, double click to install!

## Todo

Not sure if all of these are possible, but things I'd like to add.

- [ ] Add right click dialog
- [x] Add shortcut (mac: "Ctrl+Option+C", win: "Ctrl+Alt+C")
- [x] Allow for multiple selections / Auto group selections
- [ ] Optimize with `svgo`
- [ ] Allow user to change default options
- [ ] Get cooler icon (any designers out there?!)
